## **What This Project Does**

This project provides a simple tool to calculate the distance and travel time between two locations using the Google Maps Distance Matrix API. It retrieves real-time traffic data and returns both the distance and estimated travel time considering current traffic conditions. This is particularly useful for optimizing travel plans, estimating delivery times, or building location-based services.

   - Generate an API key from the Google Cloud Console.

3. **Configure the Script**  
   - Open the script and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key:  
     ```python
     API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
     ```
   - Set your desired origin and destination:  
     ```python
     origin = 'Tokyo Station'
     destination = 'Narita Airport'
     ```

4. **Run the Script**
